# ABSTRACT

This project is based on the concept of managing student data. It has two main panels, one for students and one for administrators. Before stepping into the main menu, the user has to pass through a login system to get access to the admin or the student panel, then the user can manage information.

The administrator panel provides access to most of the key features like adding, updating, removing, viewing and searching for student edit requests and records. The student panel provides the feature to view details, and request edits.
The program mainly works on file handling through structure items.
